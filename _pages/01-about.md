I'm a physicist and scientific researcher at the Institute of Molecular Biology and Pathology (IBPM) of the National Research Council (CNR, Rome, IT). In 2003, I got my PhD at the University of Rome "Tor Vergata", where I also worked six years as postdoc. In 2009 I moved to the Sapienza University as researcher, and, since January 2014, I'm the ELIXIR Italy Training Coordinator. I'm involved in the design, organisation and delivery of bioinformatics training courses, in Train the Trainer activities, and collaborate with other ELIXIR's nodes on many training-related initiatives. I've a long track record of academic teaching (Macromolecular Structures, Python programming, Bioinformatics, Biochemistry, Protein interactions). My main research interests include protein structural bioinformatics, protein structure and function prediction and analysis, and protein interactions. I'm also strongly interested in what researchers have discovered about how people learn and how best to teach them, and how research findings in the science of learning (educational psychology) can be translated into common teaching practice. 
I'm a member of the Global Organisation of Bioinformatics Learning, Education and Training (GOBLET) and a Software/Data Carpentry Instructor and Instructor trainer.

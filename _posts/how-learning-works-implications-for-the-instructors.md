- Interact with your students as much as you can. Try to collect information about them. Starting with their names (do your best to learn them as soon as possible during the course). 

- Assess students' prior knowledge.
Distribute a pre-course questionnaire askomg them about their general background, prior knowledge in relation to the discipline and the course topics, and what they believe is the course about.

- Try to understand students' goals, motivation, and expectations.

- Good teaching/training implies a lot of work in course and material preparation. 
	- Identify goals (both general and specific ones)
	- Develop performance criteria (rubrics) --> to be also shared with students
	- Identify appropriate level of challenge

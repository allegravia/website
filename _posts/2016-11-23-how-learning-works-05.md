What Kinds of Practice and Feedback Enhance Learning?
=

> **Principle**: Goal-directed practice coupled with targeted feedback are critical to learning.

The three players here are "Learning goals", "Practice", "Feedback". As in the Principle statement, they are closely interconnected despite, here, practice and feedback are discussed separately. 

## Practice
**Focusing practice on a specific goal or criterion**

Goal-directed practice is crucial. "Goals provide students with focus for their learning, which leads to more time and energy going to that area of focus". It is good to know that instructors can help students by clearly articulating their goals. 
However, instructors sometimes are confused about their own learning goals. It happend to me to have a general learning goal, but being unaware of "sub-goals", specific to small tasks. In order to become aware about our learning goals (and if there is only one per simple task) I believe we have to work hard in practicals preparation. Each piece of practical should be based on very focussed learning objectives. Using mental maps may help us to better understand what are our goals and how many goals we "put" on a single task.
For example, when I prepared exercises for the Parsing session, I only had one main learning goal, which was "students will be able to parse text files".
By gaining more experience, I realised that File parsing includes several different actions and each action should be connected to a different goal. For example: "reading a text file" has a learning goal per se (the student will be able to use the "open()" function to prepare a file for reading and use methods of file objects to read its content);  "write a for loop" has a different learning goal (the student will be able to write simple "for loops" and use them to run over the lines of a file"), etc. 

I've noticed that in this book (and also in the SWC instructor training language) "Learning goals", "Learning outcomes" or "Learning objectives" are used interchangeably. 
However, in different contexts, I've been taught that Learning objectives are not the same as Learning outcomes.
